Create a simple HTML5-based memory match game for web browsers.
Game Requirements:
* Layout: The game should use a 4x4 grid of cards.
* Cards: Instead of using images, each card must display an emoji representing an iconic landmark from around the world. Use the following landmark–emoji pairs (or similar):
   * Eiffel Tower: 🗼
   * Colosseum: 🏟️
   * Great Wall of China: 🧱 (use to represent a long wall)
   * Pyramids: 🔺
   * Statue of Liberty: 🗽
   * Hagia Sophia: 🕌
   * Taj Mahal: 🏰
   * Christ the Redeemer: 🗿
* Game Mechanics:
   * When the player clicks on two cards:
      * If they match (i.e., show the same emoji), keep them flipped open.
      * If they don't match, flip them back after a short delay.
   * Incorporate light animations for card flipping and add a gentle flip sound effect.
* Completion: Once all matches are found, display the message: “Congratulations! You’ve completed your World Tour!”
* Optional Feature: When a match is made, optionally display a fun fact about the respective landmark.
* Interface: Ensure the game interface is colorful, mobile-friendly, and visually appealing.
* Constraints: Do not use any external libraries.
